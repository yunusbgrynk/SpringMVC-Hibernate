# Spring MVC - Hibernate Web App

Customer Registration Form

It's my first beginner web app.
In this project, I've created full working Spring MVC Hibernate application that connects to database.
Via the web page we have send information to database.

In this project, we realized the relationship with our database by using hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM library develop for java developers. Hibernate provides the relationship with the database to the object oriented models, facilitates the operations on database, also strengthens the established structure.
